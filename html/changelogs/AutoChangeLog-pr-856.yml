  - rscadd: Roboticists rejoice. NanoTrasen has heard your cries for help. They've
      seen CCTV footage (recorded by the AI) of you all staring enviously at geneticists,
      lording around their shiny, polished, usable DNA Consoles. Cry no more, for
      you can now please your Silicon Overlords and robust those Machine Cultist Chaplains
      in high definition glory with a beautiful new interface added to Exosuit Fabricators.
